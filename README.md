# 👋 Hi, I'm Hai Nguyen

I'm a software engineer with over 15 years of experience building scalable, enterprise-grade platforms. I've worked at companies like Apple, Amazon, and Intuit — designing backend systems, orchestrating complex workflows, and leading architecture for high-impact services.

Outside of my professional work, I build open-source tools that solve real-world problems — with a focus on developer experience, automation, and productivity.

## 🚀 What I'm Building

I'm building [FlowInquiry](https://github.com/flowinquiry) as a side project to dive deeper into frontend development and user experience — after years of working primarily on backend systems. It’s my way of learning modern tools like React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS while designing interfaces that feel intuitive and helpful for real users.

### FlowInquiry – Smarter Ticket & Project Management

FlowInquiry is an open-source, self-hostable alternative to tools like Jira and Zendesk. It brings together:

- ✅ Project management with Kanban boards, support for iterations and epics  
- ⚙️ Custom workflows with dynamic transitions and SLA compliance  
- 🧠 AI-powered activity insights (ChatGPT, Ollama integration)  
- 📬 Real-time notifications (WebSocket, Slack, Email)  
- 🌐 Cloud-native deployment via Docker, Helm, Terraform, and Kubernetes  

Built for modern teams who want full control over their tools — without enterprise complexity.
