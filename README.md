# 👋 Hi, I'm Hai Nguyen

I'm a software engineer with over 15 years of experience building scalable, enterprise-grade platforms. I've worked at companies like Apple, Amazon, and Intuit — designing backend systems, orchestrating complex workflows, and leading architecture for high-impact services.

Outside of my professional work, I build open-source tools that solve real-world problems — with a focus on developer experience, automation, and productivity.

## 🚀 What I'm Building

I'm building [FlowInquiry](https://github.com/flowinquiry) as a side project to dive deeper into frontend development and user experience — after years of working primarily on backend systems. It’s my way of learning modern tools like React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS while designing interfaces that feel intuitive and helpful for real users.

### FlowInquiry – Smarter Ticket & Project Management

FlowInquiry is an open-source, self-hostable alternative to tools like Jira and Zendesk. It brings together:

- ✅ Project management with Kanban boards, support for iterations and epics  
- ⚙️ Custom workflows with dynamic transitions and SLA compliance  
- 🧠 AI-powered activity insights (ChatGPT, Ollama integration)  
- 📬 Real-time notifications (WebSocket, Slack, Email)  
- 🌐 Cloud-native deployment via Docker, Helm, Terraform, and Kubernetes  

Built for modern teams who want full control over their tools — without enterprise complexity.

### Askimo – AI at Your Command Line  
Alongside FlowInquiry, I’m also building **Askimo**, a powerful, pluggable command-line chat assistant that connects directly with AI models like OpenAI and Ollama.  

**Askimo highlights:**  
💬 Real-time streaming chat right in your terminal  
🔌 Extensible plugin system for custom commands and providers  
⚡ Native binary builds for instant startup (via GraalVM)  
🛠 Session-based configuration stored locally for seamless workflows  
📜 Supports both interactive REPL mode and pipe execution  

Askimo is built for developers who want the flexibility of AI tools without leaving the terminal.

Both projects reflect my passion for building practical, developer-friendly tools:  
- **FlowInquiry** helps teams manage projects with clarity and control.  
- **Askimo** brings the power of AI into everyday developer workflows.
